# Unitree A1 ROS2 Driver
The UNOFFICIAL ROS2 driver for Unitree robotics dog A1



## Setting up

#### Workspace setup
Please make sure you have the following checked out in your colcon workspace together:
- https://github.com/huawei-ros/unitree_legged_sdk
- https://github.com/lcm-proj/lcm
- http://github.com/crystaldust/unitree_a1_ros2.git

Once the two former packages are released upstream, `rosdep install` should be sufficient to pull in dependencies.

## Unitree A1 high level state support list

The Unitree SDK define a "HighState" to present the high level control of the robotics dog, there are still some constraints of the driver because some features are missing from the SDK([unitree_legged_sdk](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_legged_sdk))

### Comment:
1.Setting sport mode is not supported through calling unitree sdk.

2.In normal mode, the robot dog will drift when stepping, It's best to develop in sport mode.

3.Getting temperature in sport mode is not supported.

4.Getting the current mode of the robot dog is not supported.
